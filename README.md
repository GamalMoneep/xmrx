# XMRX Tool

XMRX Tool is an automated framework designed to streamline vulnerability discovery and reporting for penetration testing.

## Key Features
- **Scope Discovery:** Identifies platforms, targets, and scope files.
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Discovers subdomains related to a target.
- **Endpoint Extraction:** Extracts endpoints from websites and APIs.
- **Service & Port Scanning:** Scans for open ports and services.
- **WAF Detection:** Detects Web Application Firewalls.
- **Tech Stack & OS Detection:** Identifies the underlying technologies and operating systems.
- **Directory Bruteforce & Parameter Fuzzing:** Uncovers hidden directories and potential vulnerabilities.
- **JS Auditing:** Scans JavaScript files for hardcoded secrets and unsafe patterns.
- **LLM Integration:** Analyzes collected data and generates detailed vulnerability reports.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Agents perform enumeration, scanning, and extraction.
2. **Data Analysis:** Information is processed and analyzed.
3. **Reporting:** An LLM generates actionable reports based on the findings.

## Future Enhancements
- Additional vulnerability detection modules.
- Enhanced data processing and automation features.
